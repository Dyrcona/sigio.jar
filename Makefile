# We make a few assumptions in the Makefile, for now.
#
# 1. We assume that your javac, javadoc and jar tools are already in
# your executable path.  We might add a JDKPATH or some such variable
# so you specify which JDK tools to use in the future.
#
# 2. We assume that your CLASSPATH is set up properly and includes the
# Rhino jar file.  At some point in the future, we'll likely add a
# variable to set the path to Rhino.  (Rhino is currently the only
# non-standard package needed by sigio.jar.)
